# US Household Income Analysis

## Description
This repository contains SQL files used for a mini-project analyzing US household income for the year 2023 as part of a MySQL course I took. The two data sets used in this project were provided by the course, where one contains geographic information and the other contains income statistics. In this project I cleaned both data sets through identifying duplicate rows and mispellings and updating the datasets accordingly. From there, the data was joined together to perfrom exploratory data analysis to look at income over states, cities, and counties.
This was a fun project given the freedom and vast amount of information to explore, giving me the opportunity to look at income data from just about anywhere in the United States.
